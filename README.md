# rshell (v1.0)
#### Why rshell?
You might think your current terminal 'works.' You may even have a smug sense that it's one of the best out there since thousands of people have contributed in the making of it.

I'm here to tell you you're wrong.

*(Enter rshell stage left)* Here I present to you, the infamous rshell! Thought your terminal was good enough? Think again!

With its fluid and dynamic interface, rshell will outdo any other shell you can think of! ~~more buzzwords here~~ Just run the executable and rshell will actively wait for you, letting you dictate its every action!

#### Installation
Just run the following commands in your normal (boring) shell and **bam!** you'll have rshell up and running!

    $ git clone  http://github.com/yourusername/rshell.git
    $ cd rshell
    $ git checkout hw0
    $ make
    $ bin/rshell
